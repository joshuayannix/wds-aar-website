    <p>
      The all americans rejects are a rock/alternative genre band. They were one of my favorite bands growing up. Some
      of
      their best songs include Dirty Little Secret, Move Along, It Ends Tonight, Swing Swing, Stab My Back, Night Drive,
      Top of the World, Paper Heart. Move Along was definitely their best album, full of absolute bangers. I don't
      really like any of the stuff they came out with afterwards. The most "recent" song I've listened from them was
      "Gives You Hell," and while it's not a bad song, I remember I hated it because it was completley different from
      Move Along.
